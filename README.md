Practice HTML skills by developing a basic recipe website!

With this project, the goal is to illustrate my skills with HTML by creating a main page with several links to pages containing recipes.

Each recipe has a list of ingredients along with steps to follow to prepare the food. At the top of each page of a recipe, there will be an image displayed of the food that belongs with the recipe.

This project illustrates my knowledge of headers, links, anchors, lists, and any other basics required for HTML.
